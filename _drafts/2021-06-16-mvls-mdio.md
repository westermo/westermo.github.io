In this the third part of the series of useful tools for networking
devices, we good deep and look at `mdio` & `mvls` from the GitHub
[mdio-tools][] project.  They communicate with MDIO devices using the
Linux devlink API.

Other tools in this domain exist, but mdio-tools provides us with a
way to do *direct addressing* on MDIO buses and, most importantly,
*atomic operations* even of complex things like read-mask-write.

<!-- more -->

To list all buses:

```sh
~$ mdio bus
```

To show all switchcore ports:

```sh
~$ mvls port
```

To show the PVT:

```sh
~$ mvls pvt
```

To show the ATU:

```sh
~$ mvls atu
```

To read/write a switchcore reister

```sh
~$ mdio mvls 10* 4 raw PORT REG [VAL]
```

To read/write a PHY register:

```sh
~$ mdio phy *mdio PORT raw REG [VAL]
```


<!-- scribbled notes from meeting, obviously wrong -->

mdio mbl 10002b* 4 raw 0x10 3

mdio mbl 10002b* 4 raw 0x10 0
mdio mbl 10002b* 4 raw 0x11 0
mdio mbl 10002b* 4 raw 0x12 0

mdio phy *mdioe 9 raw 3
