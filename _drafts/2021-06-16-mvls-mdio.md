In this the third part of the series of useful tools for networking
devices, we good deep and look at `mdio` & `mvls` from the GitHub
[mdio-tools][] project.  They communicate with MDIO devices using the
Linux devlink API.

Other tools in this domain exist, but mdio-tools provides us with a
way to do *direct addressing* on MDIO buses and, most importantly,
*atomic operations* even of complex things like read-mask-write.
